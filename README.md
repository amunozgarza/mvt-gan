# MVT-GAN

This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation of Multi-Variate Temporal GAN for Large Scale Video Generation. Further details can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01823

To reproduce results download the pre-trained weights, then start training.

To train the network run the script run_video_gan.sh.

To test results run create_dataset.sh.
